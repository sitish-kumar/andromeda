// Guards the ABI Umbriel depends on: umbrielfx replaces wlroots' scene graph,
// but reuses the scene helpers it does not reimplement
// (wlr_scene_xdg_surface_create, wlr_scene_subsurface_tree_create,
// wlr_scene_layer_surface_v1_create, wlr_scene_drag_icon_create,
// wlr_scene_attach_output_layout, ...) straight from libwlroots. Those read and
// write the structs below at wlroots' field offsets, so every field wlroots
// declares must sit at the same offset in umbrielfx's version.
//
// Built twice, once against each header, and the two outputs are compared.
// The same field list compiles on both sides, so a field wlroots adds that
// umbrielfx lacks breaks the build rather than the renderer.
