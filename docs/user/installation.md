# Installing Umbriel

Umbriel is available for Arch Linux, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. You can also
[build it manually](#manual-build) on another Linux distribution.

> Package ownership: the Umbriel team maintains the manual build instructions.
> Distribution packages are maintained by their distributions or package
> repository maintainers. Review third-party repositories before installing
> from them.

## Arch Linux

[`umbriel-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/umbriel-git) is available in
the AUR:

```sh
yay -S umbriel-git
```

## Fedora

[Terra](https://wiki.fyralabs.com/Terra) provides nightly builds:

```sh
sudo dnf install umbriel-nightly
```

## openSUSE

[home:neifua:Noctalia](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:neifua:Noctalia) repo provides [umbriel-git](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:neifua:Noctalia/umbriel-git) on OBS.

#### Tumbleweed
```sh
sudo zypper addrepo --refresh --name Noctalia https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:neifua:Noctalia/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:neifua:Noctalia.repo
sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper install umbriel-git
```

#### Slowroll
```sh
sudo zypper addrepo --refresh --name Noctalia https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:neifua:Noctalia/openSUSE_Slowroll/home:neifua:Noctalia.repo
sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper install umbriel-git
```

## Debian and Ubuntu

The NickH APT repository provides Umbriel for Debian-based distributions.

### Install the repository signing key

```sh
wget https://pkg.noctalia.dev/deb/nickh-archive-keyring.deb
sudo dpkg -i nickh-archive-keyring.deb
```

### Add the repository

Choose the source matching your distribution:

```sh
# Debian Trixie
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/noctalia-trixie.sources \
  https://pkg.noctalia.dev/deb/noctalia-trixie.sources

# Debian Sid
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/noctalia-unstable.sources \
  https://pkg.noctalia.dev/deb/noctalia-unstable.sources

# Ubuntu 26.04
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/noctalia-resolute.sources \
  https://pkg.noctalia.dev/deb/noctalia-resolute.sources
```

### Install Umbriel

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install umbriel
```

The repository provides `amd64` and `arm64` packages only.

## GNU Guix

Umbriel and its XDG portal may be installed through the third-party `midnight` guix channel.

First, add the following to your channels list in `~/.config/guix/channels.scm`:

```scheme
(channel
    (name 'midnight)
    (url "https://codeberg.org/stampede/midnight.git")
    (branch "main")
    (introduction
        (make-channel-introduction
            "d97d1568954cfcbf543c9fcdfd5771e2b730ae19"
            (openpgp-fingerprint
                "640A 2C3C E948 22D3 394B 40C3 CAFA EECA 00FF 9B1E"))))
```

Then, run `guix pull` to update your channels (or optionally run `guix pull --select=midnight` instead to only pull this channel). Then you're free to install the package however you want, whether that be using `guix insall umbriel xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel` or adding them to your declarative config.

It is highly recommended to add the umbriel package to your system configuration rather than your home one, so that the `.desktop` file provided by the package may be picked up by your greeter/display manager, and be displayed in your list of available sessions. Like so:

```scheme
(use-modules (midnight packages umbriel)
             ...)

(operating-system
    (packages
        (list
            umbriel
            xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel
            ...))
    ...)
```

## Manual build

Manual installations have no automatic upgrade path. Prefer a distribution
package when one is available.

Install a C++23 compiler, Meson, Ninja, `just`, `pkg-config`,
`wayland-scanner`, and the development packages listed in
[`PACKAGING.md`](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel/blob/main/PACKAGING.md#dependencies).
Then clone, build, and
install Umbriel:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel.git
cd umbriel
just release
sudo just install
```

The default installation prefix is `/usr/local`. Set `prefix` when building to
install elsewhere:

```sh
just prefix="$HOME/.local" release
just install
```

## Starting Umbriel

Installed display-manager sessions use `start-umbriel`. For supported account
shells listed in `/etc/shells`, including bash, zsh, and fish, the launcher
enters the configured shell as a noninteractive login shell before starting a
native session. Exports from its login profile, such as `~/.zprofile` for zsh,
are inherited by Umbriel and the session. Interactive startup files such as
`~/.zshrc` are not read. Starting `start-umbriel` from a TTY performs this step
even if the TTY login already loaded the profile.

For a native launch with a reachable systemd user manager, the launcher imports
that environment and runs Umbriel as a user service. This also includes
variables from `environment.d`. Without one, and for nested launches, it starts
the compositor directly with the login environment.

In a managed native session, Umbriel uses `systemd-run` to place the `-s`
startup command and each autostart, event hook, and `spawn:` command in a
separate transient scope under `app.slice`. This requires systemd 254 or newer.
Each scope is part of `umbriel-session.target` and bound to the systemd unit
that owns the compositor, normally `umbriel.service`. Stopping either one, or
an unexpected compositor exit, cleans up the scope, even if the session target
failed to activate. An application failure or OOM kill does not propagate back
to `umbriel.service`. `systemd-run` starts the command only after scope creation
succeeds. Direct and nested sessions do not invoke it and launch these commands
as ordinary compositor children.

Run `umbriel` directly for nested development sessions or explicit unmanaged
startup.

From a TTY, start a normal installed session with:

```sh
start-umbriel
```

## Logs

Umbriel writes its main log to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/umbriel/umbriel.log`. If
`XDG_CACHE_HOME` is unset, the fallback path is
`~/.cache/umbriel/umbriel.log`. The previous file is retained as
`umbriel.log.1` when the current log reaches 1 MiB.

When standard output or standard error is connected to a TTY, raw writes from
Umbriel and its child processes are redirected to
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/umbriel/umbriel-stderr.log`, or
`~/.cache/umbriel/umbriel-stderr.log` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is unset.
