# Layout

Choose one of Umbriel's three layout modes for each workspace: Scrolling,
Dwindle, or Master. Configure a default mode globally, then override it for
individual workspaces when needed.

## Choose a layout

```toml
[layout]
mode = "scrolling" # "scrolling", "dwindle", or "master"
```

| Mode | Arrangement | Best suited to |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `scrolling` | Columns form a scrollable strip. Each column can contain stacked windows. | Workflows that keep many windows available without shrinking every column. |
| `dwindle` | Each new window splits an existing tile. | Recursive tiling with independently sized regions. |
| `master` | Windows occupy a master area and a stack area. | Keeping one or more primary windows separate from the rest. |

The active mode can also be changed with `workspace-set-layout:<mode>`; see
[Actions](actions.md#parameterized-actions). A workspace rule can set a
persistent per-workspace mode; see [Workspace Rules](workspaces.md#workspace-rules).

## Shared settings

```toml
[layout]
gap = 8
width_presets = [0.333, 0.5, 0.667]
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gap` | int | `8` | Gap between windows in pixels (0-500). |
| `width_presets` | float array | `[0.333, 0.5, 0.667]` | Fractions used by `window-cycle-width` and `window-cycle-height` in every layout. Both actions use this one list. |

### Struts

```toml
[layout.struts]
left = 0
right = 0
top = 0
bottom = 0
```

Struts reserve signed logical pixels around the normal tiled layout. Umbriel
applies them after layer-shell exclusive zones, so positive values reserve more
space inward from panels, while negative values expand the tiled area and can
place windows beneath panels or beyond an output edge. Each edge accepts a value
from `-65535` to `65535`.

All three tiled layouts use the resulting area. On the scrolling axis, struts
leave room beyond the viewport where neighboring lanes can remain visible.
Floating windows and popups ignore struts. A full-width tiled column still
respects struts and gaps; maximize-to-edges ignores struts, gaps, and borders
but keeps layer-shell exclusive zones visible; fullscreen fills the entire
output.

`Mod+Right-drag` selects horizontal and vertical resize edges from the outer
thirds of tiled and floating windows. Dragging from a corner resizes both axes.
Mod+Right-click in the center starts no resize and preserves the window's
maximize state. For a tiled window, a center click also scrolls the focused
window into view. When a tiled resize ends, a focused scrolling column animates
back into view. In Dwindle, only edges backed by an internal split propose a
resize; screen-facing edges propose nothing.

## Scrolling layout

Scrolling keeps columns at their configured widths and moves the strip through a
viewport. A column can contain multiple windows. The `direction` setting changes
which screen axis is the strip axis.

### Settings

```toml
[layout.scrolling]
direction = "horizontal"             # "horizontal" or "vertical"
default_width_fraction = 0.5         # remove to let clients choose, 0.1-1.0
center_underfull_strip = true
center_focused = false
expand_single_column = true
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `direction` | string | `"horizontal"` | Strip axis: `"horizontal"` places columns left to right, while `"vertical"` places lanes top to bottom. |
| `default_width_fraction` | float | unset | Initial strip-axis extent for new columns (0.1-1.0). The packaged config sets `0.5`; when omitted, the client chooses its initial extent. |
| `center_underfull_strip` | bool | `true` | Center the complete strip when it is shorter than the viewport. Disable to align it at the start edge. |
| `center_focused` | bool | `false` | Always center the focused column. |
| `expand_single_column` | bool | `false` | Fill the viewport for a workspace's lone tiled column. Client size hints and viewport bounds still apply. The packaged config enables this. |

### Horizontal and vertical scrolling

| Direction | Layout | Width and height actions |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| `horizontal` | Columns run left to right. Windows within a column stack from top to bottom. | Width actions change a column's strip extent. Height actions change a window's extent within its column. |
| `vertical` | Horizontal lanes run top to bottom. Windows within a lane sit side by side. | Width actions change a lane's strip extent, which is its height on screen. Height actions change a window's extent within its lane, which is its visual width. |

For a vertical workspace, directional actions follow the screen. Left and
right move within a lane, while up and down walk or reorder lanes. The consume
and expel actions use the same visual directions: left and right merge or split
within the lane, while the resulting lane is above or below the focused lane.

The three-finger vertical swipe continues to switch workspaces. A three-finger
horizontal swipe scrolls a horizontal strip and is inert on a vertical one. Use
keyboard or wheel bindings to scroll a vertical strip. On a horizontal strip,
release velocity settles a three-finger swipe against a viewport edge.

### Scrolling behavior

The packaged config sets `default_width_fraction = 0.5`, so new columns start at
half the viewport. If the option is omitted, Umbriel leaves the strip-axis
extent unconstrained during the initial configure and retains the logical size
chosen by the client. A numeric `default_width` window rule takes precedence.

`expand_single_column` affects only how a lone tiled column is displayed. It
does not rewrite the stored fraction, so the configured or client-selected
width applies again when a second column appears. Explicit
`default_maximize` and `default_maximize_to_edges` window rules take precedence.

When focus moves to a hidden or partially hidden column, Umbriel reveals it by
the shortest distance needed to show it completely. A column entering from the
right aligns with the right viewport edge, and one entering from the left aligns
with the left edge. Focus does not reserve a visible sliver for the next column.
Resizing a column recenters an underfull strip immediately.

Dragged windows become translucent so the insertion preview remains visible.
Existing window transparency still applies during the drag. When a column is
dragged, the preview uses the free space beside the real column edges. If the
strip extends beyond the output, its far left and right edges remain available
as prepend and append targets even when the end columns are off-screen.

Dropping a window into empty space above or below a vertically resized stack
consumes that space. Existing windows retain their pixel heights, and the
dropped window fills the remainder apart from the configured gap.

## Dwindle layout

Dwindle recursively splits tiles. Each tiled leaf is a single-window column, so
column actions operate on individual windows in this mode.

### Settings

```toml
[layout.dwindle]
preserve_split = false # keep each split direction fixed after creation
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preserve_split` | bool | `false` | Keep each split direction fixed after it is created. |

### Behavior

A new window splits the focused tile along its longer edge and becomes the right
or bottom half. With `preserve_split = false`, split directions follow each
tile's shape as geometry changes, so closing a window can reflow surviving
splits. Dropping on a specific edge keeps that direction. Set
`preserve_split = true` to freeze every split direction when it is created.

When a window or column moves onto a Dwindle workspace, a multi-window column is
flattened into ordered single-window columns. This is also how drag-and-drop
handles a column that enters Dwindle.

## Master layout

Master divides the workspace into a master area and a stack area. The master
area is on the side selected by `position`; the stack occupies the other side.
Each area arranges its windows from top to bottom. When only one area has
windows, that area fills the complete content box.

### Settings

```toml
[layout.master]
position = "left"                   # "left" or "right"
default_width_fraction = 0.55       # 0.1-0.9
new_on_top = true                    # place new windows at the top of the stack
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | string | `"left"` | Side occupied by the master area: `"left"` or `"right"`. |
| `default_width_fraction` | float | `0.55` | Initial fraction assigned to the master area when both areas exist (0.1-0.9). |
| `new_on_top` | bool | `true` | Place new windows at the top of the stack. Disable to place them at the bottom. |

### Behavior

The first window becomes master. A new window also becomes master when the
master area is empty. Otherwise it joins the top of the stack when
`new_on_top = true`, or the bottom when it is false. Removing the final master
window promotes the top stack window. Moving every window out of master does
not promote one, so the remaining stack stays full-width until another window
opens or is moved into master.

Consume actions preserve their visual meanings. With `position = "left"`, left
moves a stack window into master and right moves a master window into the stack.
With `position = "right"`, those roles reverse because master is visually right.
The consume-or-expel variants make the same directional move.

Master workflows use a deterministic layout-order ring: master windows from top
to bottom, then stack windows from top to bottom. `window-focus-next` and
`window-focus-previous` cycle through that ring and wrap. The swap actions
exchange the focused window with its neighboring slot while keeping focus on
that window. `master-count-increase` promotes the stack top into master, and
`master-count-decrease` demotes the master bottom into the stack. At least one
window remains in master.

Width actions operate on the master fraction; the stack fraction is its
complement. `window-modify-width:<delta>` changes the focused area's fraction,
and the cycle actions walk `width_presets`. Width actions are inert while either
area is empty because the occupied area already fills the viewport. Height
actions change a window's row fraction within its area and are inert when that
window is the area's only row. Tiled resizing is available on the boundary
between master and stack and between rows in either area.

Dragging over a master workspace previews the destination row within the
nearest area. Hint bands appear at the top, bottom, and between existing rows.
Dropping inserts the window at that row.
