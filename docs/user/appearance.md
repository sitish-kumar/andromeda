# Appearance

Configure colors, window appearance, blur, shadows, and other visual effects.

## Colors

```toml
[colors]
background = "#141419FF"
text_primary = "#E8E8EAFF"
text_muted = "#8A8A92FF"
accent_primary = "#7AA3FFFF"
accent_secondary = "#F5C96BFF"
warning = "#F5C96BFF"
error = "#FF6B6BFF"
```

Shared semantic colors for Umbriel-owned interface surfaces such as the keybind
cheatsheet and configuration diagnostic banner. Colors are `#RRGGBB` or
`#RRGGBBAA`.

| Key                | Type  | Default     | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `background`       | color | `#141419FF` | Shared background for internal panels and banners. |
| `text_primary`     | color | `#E8E8EAFF` | Primary text.                                      |
| `text_muted`       | color | `#8A8A92FF` | Secondary help and status text.                    |
| `accent_primary`   | color | `#7AA3FFFF` | Primary emphasis, including titles, key chords, and the cheatsheet border. |
| `accent_secondary` | color | `#F5C96BFF` | Secondary emphasis, including group headings.      |
| `warning`          | color | `#F5C96BFF` | Warning status text.                               |
| `error`            | color | `#FF6B6BFF` | Error text and the session-quit confirmation border.             |

Key chord backgrounds are derived from `background` and `text_primary`; they
remain opaque so text stays legible over translucent panels.

Modal panels use their semantic colors as borders: one logical pixel of
`accent_primary` around the keybind cheatsheet, and two logical pixels of
`error` around the smaller session-quit confirmation.

With `prefer_no_csd = true`, Umbriel advertises the XDG and KDE decoration
managers and prefers its border-only server decoration. An explicit request for
client-side decorations is still honored. With `false`, Umbriel hides both
managers from newly connected clients so toolkits such as Qt draw their own
decorations. Protocol visibility is fixed when an application connects, so
restart applications after changing this setting.

Colors are `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`.

Border widths and corner radius are measured in logical pixels. `corner_radius`
describes the final outside edge of the complete decoration. Positive color-seam
and content radii decrease smoothly as their border inset grows, but never
collapse to square; `corner_radius = 0` keeps every contour square. Inner and
outer borders render outside the window and are included in layout spacing.

See [Scratchpads](scratchpad.md) for how scratchpad windows behave and use the
dedicated border colors.

### Blur

```toml
[appearance.blur]
enabled = true
optimized = true
passes = 3        # 0-8
radius = 5        # 0-100
noise = 0.02      # 0.0-1.0
brightness = 0.9  # 0.0-2.0
contrast = 0.9    # 0.0-2.0
saturation = 1.1  # 0.0-2.0
```

`enabled` is the master switch. Individual surfaces must still opt in through
[window rules](window-rules.md) or [layer rules](layer-rules.md).
Blur only renders where a surface is transparent. Sampling remains confined to
the surface's owning output when a window overflows into a neighbouring output.
Disabling the master switch also releases SceneFX's per-output blur render
targets.

| ------------ | ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`    | bool  | `true`  | Master blur switch.                                                                                                              |
| `optimized`  | bool  | `true`  | Use one cached background blur per output for all surfaces. This is the X-ray mode: translucent surfaces blur the background beneath the window stack instead of the surfaces behind them. |
| `passes`     | int   | `3`     | Blur passes (0-8). 0 disables.                                           |
| `radius`     | int   | `5`     | Blur radius (0-100). 0 disables.                                         |
| `noise`      | float | `0.02`  | Noise overlay (0.0-1.0).                                                 |
| `brightness` | float | `0.9`   | Brightness adjustment (0.0-2.0).                                         |
| `contrast`   | float | `0.9`   | Contrast adjustment (0.0-2.0).                                           |
| `saturation` | float | `1.1`   | Saturation adjustment (0.0-2.0).                                         |

### Shadow

```toml
[appearance.shadow]
enabled = true
softness = 10      # 0-200
offset_x = 2       # -200 to 200
offset_y = 2
color = "#0000007F"
```

Drop shadow behind windows (tiled and floating). Hidden while fullscreen.

| Key        | Type  | Default     | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`  | bool  | `true`      | Enable drop shadows.                                                   |
| `softness` | int   | `10`        | Gaussian blur sigma in pixels (0-200). 0 produces a hard-edged shadow. |
| `offset_x` | int   | `2`         | Horizontal shadow offset (-200 to 200).                                |
| `offset_y` | int   | `2`         | Vertical shadow offset (-200 to 200).                                  |
| `color`    | color | `#0000007F` | Shadow color.                                                          |
