# Maintainer design notes

The main documentation explains how to configure and use Umbriel. The notes in
this directory preserve detailed contracts and implementation constraints for
people changing the compositor.

Start with the user guide when a detail affects configuration or normal use.
Use a design note when the detail explains state transitions, subsystem
boundaries, or regression-sensitive behavior.

## Harness-only IPC

`settle`, `clock-freeze`, `clock-advance`, `clock-resume`, `output-create`,
and `output-destroy` exist for `tests/harness` and are compiled only with the
`test_ipc` option (auto: debug builds). `settle` replies once no animation is
running, no workspace has an arrange pending, and every output has drawn a frame
since the request; it errors after 30 seconds.

Every animation ticks from `Server::animationClockMsec`. `clock-freeze` stops it,
`clock-advance <ms>` moves it forward and replies once every output has drawn a
frame at the new time, and `clock-resume` continues from the frozen time so
animation time never runs backwards. An animation that starts while frozen
counts from the frozen instant. Frozen time does not reach clients, input
timestamps, or compositor timers, and `settle` cannot succeed while a frozen
animation is still running. `output-create` and `output-destroy` work only on
the headless backend.

## Pointer drag completion

A client data-device drag temporarily replaces normal pointer delivery with a
seat grab. When the initiating button release ends that grab,
`Cursor::processButton` reruns pointer motion at the unchanged layout position.
This is required even when the pointer did not move: clients use the fresh
surface-local input to recalculate hover state and restore their cursor image.
When `follows_mouse` is enabled, the same refresh selects a different window
under the pointer and restores keyboard focus there after the drag grab ends.
The short-drag cursor refresh is covered by
[`460_external_drag.sh`](../../tests/harness/checks/460_external_drag.sh), and
cross-window focus is covered by
[`471_data_drag_hover_focus.sh`](../../tests/harness/checks/471_data_drag_hover_focus.sh).
