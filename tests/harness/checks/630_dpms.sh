# DPMS is compositor-owned output power, not output removal. A named action must
# remain in effect while another monitor is awake. A bare action must affect
# every configured monitor, ignore the input release that triggered it, then
# wake every monitor on genuinely new input. Two monitors are the whole point,
# which the header directive above asks the harness for.
