# Closing a window that is off-screen to the left does not shift the visible ones.
#
# Removing a column closes the space it held, so everything to its right moves
# left by its width plus a gap. When that column sat off-screen to the left the
# user never asked to see that happen, and the window they are actually reading
# jumps sideways. Re-anchoring on removal prevents that shift.
#
# The geometry is pinned by unit tests in tests/scrolling_layout.cpp. What this
# adds is that it reaches the real close path, measured in
# Workspace::detachFromLayout before the column goes.
#
# The setup is fussy for a reason, and the fussiness is the check. Removal is
# followed by ensureFocusedVisible, which clamps the scroll into the focused
# column's visible band; that clamp absorbs the whole shift whenever the scroll
# is already sitting at a band edge, and every focus-driven route leaves it
# exactly there. So the earlier versions of this check passed with the
# compensation ripped out. The scroll has to be strictly inside the band, which
# means putting it there by hand (layout-scroll-left, or a touchpad swipe in
# real use), and that is also the only situation in which a user sees the bug.
