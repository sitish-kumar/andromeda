# The diagnostics panel is drawn like the other internal panels, with a border that reports severity: the warning colour while the configuration still applied, the error colour once it did not. Colour and geometry are the whole signal, so this samples the two border rows alone rather than the panel interior, where the severity-coloured heading would satisfy the same assertion without any border being drawn. Each state is asserted against the one before it, so a panel stuck on its first severity fails even though every individual colour is present somewhere.
