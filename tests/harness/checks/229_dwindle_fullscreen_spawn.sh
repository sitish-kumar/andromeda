# In dwindle, a new tiled window normally maps below an existing fullscreen window. The fullscreen action must still
# leave the visible fullscreen state. With new_exits_fullscreen enabled, only a window arriving on the workspace exits
# fullscreen: opening it there, a late title rule completing its initial placement, or moving it in from another
# workspace. Attaching an existing floating window to the layout, or moving a window to the workspace it is already
# on, leaves fullscreen unchanged. The scope selects which kinds of arriving window count.
