# Pointer hit-testing: a click focuses the window under the cursor. This is the check that was missing when a change to View's base classes moved its SceneNode subobject off offset zero, so Server::viewAt returned null for every window and click-to-focus, interactive move, and interactive resize all stopped working. Nothing else in the harness touches that path: every other check drives the compositor through IPC actions, which never hit-test. The headless backend has no input devices, so the cursor is driven through zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1 by tests/harness/clients/pointer_client.cpp. The compositor attaches it to its wlr_cursor like a physical mouse, so these events take the same path real input does.
