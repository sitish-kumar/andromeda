# Packaging Noctalia Greeter

Notes for distribution packagers. End-user install docs live in the
[README](README.md) and at [docs.noctalia.dev](https://docs.noctalia.dev).

## Package description

Use this short description for package metadata (`pkgdesc`, `Summary`,
AppStream, etc.):

> A minimal login greeter for greetd that matches the look and feel of Noctalia Shell.

## Identity

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | `noctalia-greeter` |
| Homepage | https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-greeter |
| Docs | https://docs.noctalia.dev |
| License | MIT ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) |
| Version | Meson `project(... version: ...)` in [`meson.build`](meson.build) |
| Session wrapper | `noctalia-greeter-session` (what greetd should run) |

## Build

- Build system: [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) + Ninja. The repo [`Justfile`](Justfile) is convenience only.
- Language: C++20 (greeter client), C (wlroots compositor).
- Recommended for packages: `meson setup build --buildtype=plain` (or `release` **without** relying on `-march=native`; the default `release` buildtype in `meson.build` enables CPU-local flags that are not portable across machines).
- **wlroots 0.20** and **wayland-server** are required (the compositor is not optional).

Install with the prefix you intend to ship. Greetd `command` must point at the installed `noctalia-greeter-session` path (often `/usr/bin/...`, not `/usr/local/bin/...`).

### Installed layout

```text
<prefix>/bin/noctalia-greeter
<prefix>/bin/noctalia-greeter-compositor
<prefix>/bin/noctalia-greeter-session
<prefix>/bin/noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance
<prefix>/bin/noctalia-greeter-print-greetd-config   # optional helper
<prefix>/share/noctalia-greeter/assets/...
<prefix>/share/noctalia-greeter/setup_greeter_system.sh
<prefix>/share/polkit-1/actions/org.noctalia.greeter.apply-appearance.policy   # optional; see Polkit
<prefix>/lib/tmpfiles.d/noctalia-greeter.conf       # optional; see below
```

The shipped `assets/` tree is **required at runtime**. Copying only `noctalia-greeter` breaks fonts, icons, and UI resources.

The conventional-distribution `passwordless-sync` policy manager is part of
the main `noctalia-greeter` binary; it does not add another installed
executable. It is usable only when the apply helper and Polkit action are also
installed in their configured prefix paths.

Install the policy in the action directory that polkitd actually loads,
normally `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`. The standard distribution prefix
`--prefix=/usr` gives that layout. A policy under `/usr/local/share` is not
normally discovered merely because the greeter was built with that prefix.

Runtime override: `NOCTALIA_GREETER_ASSETS_DIR` points at an alternate assets tree.

## Dependencies

No Qt or GTK. UI is Wayland + OpenGL ES (EGL/GLES, or `libepoxy` when separate
EGL/GLES pkg-config modules are missing).

### Build-time (required)

Canonical list is the `dependency(...)` / header checks in
[`meson.build`](meson.build). The [README](README.md) has copy-paste install
lines for common distros (Arch, Fedora, openSUSE, Debian, Void).

Notes packagers hit often:

- **wlroots 0.20** (`wlroots-0.20` pkg-config) and **wayland-server** are
  required. The compositor is not optional.
- **stb** must provide `stb/stb_image_resize2.h` (older `stb_image_resize`
  only packages are not enough).
- **libxml2** headers and pkg-config metadata are required to build the
  installed-policy validator used by `passwordless-sync enable`.

Optional at build time (only if you ship the matching feature):

- **libwebp** for WebP wallpapers when appearance is synced from Noctalia Shell
  (other raster formats use vendored Wuffs).

### Vendored (no system package)

Shipped under `third_party/`: **Wuffs** (image decode). License file lives beside
the sources.

### Runtime

| Dependency | Role |
|---|---|
| **greetd** | Display manager; greeter runs as greetd's `default_session` |
| **D-Bus** | `noctalia-greeter-session` wraps the compositor in `dbus-run-session` |
| PAM (`/etc/pam.d/greetd`) | Authentication |
| Wayland sessions | `.desktop` files under `wayland-sessions` (niri, Hyprland, etc.) |
| X11 sessions (optional) | `.desktop` files under `xsessions`, run through `noctalia-greeter-xsession` |
| `xinit` (optional) | Provides `startx`, required at runtime for `xsessions` entries to actually start (not needed for wayland-sessions) |
| wlroots 0.20 | `noctalia-greeter-compositor` (KMS, libinput, xkbcommon, wayland-server) |
| Mesa / EGL / GLES | Greeter client rendering (or epoxy where distros split packages that way) |
| Cairo, Pango, Fontconfig, FreeType, HarfBuzz, librsvg, GLib | Text and UI rendering |
| libxml2 | Validate the installed Polkit action before enabling passwordless sync |

Optional:

| Dependency | Role |
|---|---|
| **Polkit daemon and `pkexec`** | Authorize `noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance --sync`; some distributions package `pkexec` separately |
| **libwebp** | WebP wallpaper decode for that sync path (Wuffs covers other raster formats) |

Optional pairing with **[Noctalia v5](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia)**
for wallpaper/palette sync from shell settings. The constrained sync protocol
requires Greeter 1.4.0 or newer together with the next Noctalia release after
5.0.1; current `-git` packages, `main` checkouts, or manual builds from current
`main` work when both projects are up to date. Older and mixed-version
combinations retain the administrator-authenticated legacy protocol. Noctalia
requires the installed helper and its directory chain to be root-owned and not
group- or world-writable before either protocol is elevated.

## greetd integration

greetd should run the **session wrapper**, not the greeter binary directly:

```toml
[default_session]
command = "/usr/bin/noctalia-greeter-session"
user = "greeter"
```

Use the real path from your package prefix. Optional pinned session:

```toml
command = "/usr/bin/noctalia-greeter-session -- --session niri"
```

`setup_greeter_system.sh` (installed under `share/noctalia-greeter/`) prints a ready-to-paste block and patches greetd PAM for `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Packagers may wrap or invoke it from `postinst`.

Do **not** put environment assignments inside greetd TOML (`FOO=1 /path/...` is invalid). Use a plain path, or `env FOO=1 /path/...` in `command` if needed.

## Greeter session user resolution

Several tools need the Unix account greetd uses for the greeter session
(`noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance`, `setup_greeter_system.sh`, appearance sync
chown). Resolution is implemented in [`src/greeter/greetd_user.cpp`](src/greeter/greetd_user.cpp)
and exposed as `noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance --print-greeter-user`.

### Precedence

| Order | Source | When it applies |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GREETER_USER` | Explicit override (packagers, custom layouts) |
| 2 | Owner of the state dir | Dir exists and is owned by a non-root uid |
| 3 | Greetd config | `GREETD_CONFIG`, then `/etc/greetd/config.toml` |
| 4 | Fallback | First existing account named `greeter`, then `greetd` |

State dir path: `/var/lib/noctalia-greeter` by default, or `NOCTALIA_GREETER_STATE_DIR`.

Greetd config parsing looks for a session block whose `command` contains
`noctalia-greeter`, then falls back to `[default_session].user`. This is a
small hand parser, not full TOML.

### What packagers should do

**After install (recommended):** create the state dir and `chown` it to the same
user greetd runs the greeter as. Once that is done, step 2 wins and tools do not
need to read greetd config at all. This covers distros where greetd's live
config is not `/etc/greetd/config.toml`.

```sh
# Example postinst fragment (adjust user and paths)
greeter_user=greeter
state_dir=/var/lib/noctalia-greeter
install -d -m 0750 -o "${greeter_user}" -g "${greeter_user}" "${state_dir}"
```

Or run the shipped setup script as root (it resolves the user, prepares paths,
and installs default `greeter.toml`):

```sh
/usr/share/noctalia-greeter/setup_greeter_system.sh
```

**First install / greenfield:** ownership cannot work until the directory exists
and is chowned. Bootstrap uses greetd config (step 3) or `GREETER_USER`. We do
not try to discover greetd's config path from systemd units or other heuristics;
that is fragile and still misses custom layouts.

| Situation | Approach |
|---|---|
| Normal packaged install | `chown` state dir in `postinst` to session user |
| Nonstandard greetd config location | Set `GREETER_USER` for setup/sync tools, or `GREETD_CONFIG` if the file path is known |
| Manual setup on a new machine | Run `setup_greeter_system.sh` (reads standard greetd config paths) |
| NixOS | [`nix/nixos-module.nix`](nix/nixos-module.nix) wires user, tmpfiles, and greetd `command` |

### tmpfiles.d

Meson installs `lib/tmpfiles.d/noctalia-greeter.conf`, which recreates
`/var/lib/noctalia-greeter` as `greeter:greeter`. That drop-in is optional
convenience for systemd/opentmpfiles; it **hardcodes** the `greeter` user.

If your package uses a different session user, either override under
`/etc/tmpfiles.d/` or rely on `postinst` + `ensure_greeter_paths` from
`setup_greeter_system.sh` (portable across OpenRC, runit, systemd, etc.).

## System paths

| Path | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/var/lib/noctalia-greeter/` | greetd session user (`0750`) | `greeter.toml`, `sync.toml`, wallpapers, synced layout |
| `/etc/greetd/config.toml` | root (readable by greeter user) | greetd session definition (bootstrap only for user resolution) |
| `/etc/pam.d/greetd` | root | PAM stack; setup script adds elogind/systemd runtime dir module |

Override the runtime/setup state dir with `NOCTALIA_GREETER_STATE_DIR` (it must
match across greetd, setup scripts, and legacy helper modes). The constrained
`--sync` operation deliberately ignores this environment variable and supports
only `/var/lib/noctalia-greeter`; packagers using another state path must keep
sync administrator-authenticated. Use an absolute custom path and explicitly
forward the variable through the privilege boundary when invoking the legacy
helper.

Logging under greetd defaults to **syslog** (journald / system logger). The
session wrapper parks stdout/stderr; use `NOCTALIA_GREETER_LOG=stderr` or a file
path for debugging.

## Polkit (optional)

Only needed for **Noctalia Shell appearance sync**. Login and local `greeter.toml`
config work without polkit.

With Greeter 1.4.0 or newer and the next Noctalia release after 5.0.1, Shell
sync runs:

```text
pkexec noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance --sync <staging-dir>
```

Current `-git` packages, `main` checkouts, or manual builds from current `main`
use the same protocol when both projects are up to date. Older and
mixed-version combinations use the permanently supported legacy positional
call:

```text
noctalia-greeter-apply-appearance <staging-dir>
```

That legacy call must remain administrator-authenticated and may be launched
through `run0`, `pkexec`, or Noctalia's configured privilege-command prefix. It
must never be covered by a passwordless rule.

The constrained staging directory is exactly
`/run/user/$PKEXEC_UID/noctalia-greeter-sync`, on the caller's protected runtime
filesystem. A logind/elogind-style `/run/user/<uid>` runtime directory is
therefore required for this mode.

Policy ships as `org.noctalia.greeter.sync-appearance` (admin auth by default)
and matches only the helper's `--sync` mode. The constrained mode validates
caller-owned staging files, drops to `/var/lib/noctalia-greeter`'s greeter
owner, and applies appearance without accepting session commands. When the
legacy helper is launched through `pkexec`, it receives Polkit's generic
administrator authorization.

Passwordless authorization is an explicit system-administrator choice. Do not ship
a blanket `YES` rule or enable passwordless sync by default. The packaged policy
must keep administrator authentication as its default; this is a supported
long-term workflow, and omitting a site-local allow rule must produce an
administrator prompt on every constrained sync.

Conventional packages should expose the installed CLI used to manage the
site-local rule:

```text
sudo noctalia-greeter passwordless-sync enable USER
noctalia-greeter passwordless-sync status [USER]
sudo noctalia-greeter passwordless-sync disable USER
```

Do not invoke `enable` from a package installation or upgrade script. The
administrator must choose each allowed login account explicitly. The command
must manage only its own rule under `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d`, preserve other
administrator-authored policy, remove a user's managed authorization when it is
disabled, and leave no stale allow rule after every managed user is disabled.
Packages still need to ship the action XML and apply helper shown in the install
layout above.

Declarative integrations can generate the equivalent policy instead. The
project NixOS module exposes `passwordless-sync-users` and enables
Polkit/`pkexec` even when that list is empty. The
[user sync guide](docs/user/sync.md#conventional-packaged-distributions)
documents the conventional CLI, NixOS configuration, manual rule, and runtime
requirements without treating any one packaging model as universal.

Older packages do not provide the `org.noctalia.greeter.sync-appearance`
action, so the new rule cannot authorize them. Never adapt it to the old
`org.noctalia.greeter.apply-appearance` action: releases through 1.3.1 scope
that action only by executable path and it also covers the positional helper.

## What Noctalia Greeter is not

- Not a replacement for greetd itself.
- Not tied to a single distro's greetd config layout beyond the precedence table above.
