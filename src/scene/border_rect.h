  // never sits behind the window: a filled rect would tint every translucent client with the border colour, which would
  // then visibly change with focus. With a `clip` the rect shrinks to its visible part, the hole shifts to stay aligned
  // with the content, and every corner the clip cuts loses its radius so the new edge reads as a clip and not as a
  // smaller rounded window. Returns false when nothing is visible, leaving the rect sized 0x0.
