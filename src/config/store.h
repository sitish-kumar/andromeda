  // new `Config`, a new diagnostic list, a new set of files to watch (a config
  // that stops `include`-ing a file must stop watching it), and a new answer to
  // "is there even a config file". Keeping them as separate globals made it
  // possible to update one and forget another.
  //
  // `generation()` counts successful reloads. Consumers that cache anything
  // derived from the config compare it against the generation they cached at,
  // which is cheaper and less error-prone than every consumer being individually
  // re-notified from Server::applyConfig.
