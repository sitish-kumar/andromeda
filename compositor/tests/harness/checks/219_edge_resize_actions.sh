# The edge-anchored resize actions move only the named edge and leave the opposite
# one where it is, so a positive delta always grows the window from that edge. That
# is what separates them from primary and secondary extent actions, which resize
# around the layout's own anchor.
#
# The height coverage uses the middle window of a three-window column: with two
# windows each sitting at one end of a fixed-span pair the two behaviours are
# geometrically identical, so only a middle window tells them apart (the unanchored
# action drags both neighbours along, the anchored one moves exactly one of them).
# Dwindle's splits cover the width directions, where the edge facing the screen is
# the one that has to stay put, and a floating window covers the guards the
# fraction resize path applies: the fullscreen refusal, asserted on the client's
# own presentation log because the compositor corrects the geometry either way;
# the 0.1 size floor and the usable-extent ceiling; a dropped maximize; the height
# directions; the presentation animating with the opposite edge holding for the
# whole resize rather than being placed for a size the client has not committed
# yet; and a client that answers the configure with its own size (HOLD_SIZE), where
# that edge has to follow the committed geometry and not the requested one.
