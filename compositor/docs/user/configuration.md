# Configuration

## Starting configuration

The packaged starting configuration is
[`examples/config.toml`](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel/blob/main/examples/config.toml).
Copy it before making local changes:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/umbriel
cp /usr/share/umbriel/config.toml ~/.config/umbriel/config.toml
```

A manual installation under `/usr/local` places it at
`/usr/local/share/umbriel/config.toml`. Nix users should prefer
`programs.umbriel.settings` in Home Manager or hjem.

Umbriel watches the active configuration and applies valid changes when you
save. Most options reload immediately; reference tables identify options that
require a restart. If a reload fails, Umbriel keeps the last working
configuration and tries again on the next save.

Without `-c`, Umbriel checks these locations in order:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/umbriel/config.toml`
2. Each `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/umbriel/config.toml`
3. The packaged `share/umbriel/config.toml`

Use `umbriel -c <path>` to select one exact file. Umbriel never creates or
modifies a user configuration automatically.

## Diagnostics

Configuration warnings and errors appear in a panel on the primary output.
Errors keep the previous working configuration active. A warning-only panel
closes after ten seconds; an error remains until the next successful reload.

Check a file without starting the compositor:

```sh
umbriel config validate
```

The command prints every diagnostic with its file, line, and column, and exits
nonzero when it finds a problem.

List every configuration key the installed binary accepts:

```sh
umbriel config schema
umbriel config schema --json
```

Without `--json` it prints how many options each section has. With `--json` it
prints each key's path, type, range, accepted values, format, and built-in
default, plus the binary's `version` and `revision` (`null` for a build outside
git). `name[]` marks the entries of an array of tables, such as
`window_rule[].match.app_id`, and `<name>` a name you choose, such as
`output.<name>.scale`.

## Include

Split a configuration into smaller files with required or optional includes:

```toml
[include]
files = [
  "appearance.toml",
  "keybinds.toml",
]

[include.optional]
files = [
  "~/.config/umbriel/noctalia.toml",
]
```

Paths are relative to the file containing the include. `~`, `$VAR`, and
`${VAR}` are expanded. Missing optional files are ignored and watched, so
creating one later reloads the configuration.

Included files are applied in list order. The including file is applied last:

- Tables merge by key.
- Rule lists such as `[[window_rule]]` and `[[workspace]]` collect entries.
- Plain arrays and scalar values are replaced by the last file that sets them.
- Setting a rule list to `[]` discards entries collected earlier.

Every file must contain valid TOML. Duplicate device or workspace selectors,
and an effect preset defined in two files, are errors even when they come from
different files: at startup Umbriel uses the default configuration and shows
an error banner (unless the configuration sets `[drm]`, which refuses to
start), and a reload keeps the previous configuration.

If any included file defines `[drm]`, also declare `[drm]` in the main file.
This prevents an incomplete GPU exclusion policy from loading when an include
is unavailable.

## Settings made in a settings app

Changes made from a desktop settings app (Noctalia's Settings) are written to
`settings.toml` next to `config.toml`. Umbriel loads it after `config.toml` and
its includes, without an include line, so a value chosen in the app wins over
the same key written by hand. Resetting a setting in the app removes it from
`settings.toml`, and the hand-written value or the default applies again. Keys
the app can change cover input, appearance, animation, layout, workspaces, the
overview, and focus; the list is in the private protocol's
`dsk_settings_manager_v1` documentation.

## General

```toml
[general]
autostart = ["noctalia", "kitty"]
mod_key = "Super"
xwayland = true
show_cheatsheet = true
focus_on_activate = false
honor_restored_maximize = false
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autostart` | string array | `[]` | Commands started once with the session. Changes require a restart. |
| `mod_key` | string | Super, or Alt when nested | Modifier represented by `Mod` in keybinds. |
| `xwayland` | bool | `true` | Start xwayland-satellite for X11 applications. Changes require a restart. |
| `show_cheatsheet` | bool | `true` | Show the keybind cheatsheet when Umbriel starts. |
| `focus_on_activate` | bool | `false` | Let application activation requests focus and reveal their target. |
| `honor_restored_maximize` | bool | `false` | Honor maximize requests an application makes while its window opens, until it acknowledges its opening layout. |

`xwayland-satellite` must be installed and available on `PATH` when X11 support
is enabled.

## DRM devices

Use `[drm]` only when Umbriel should leave a GPU unopened in a native session.
Omit the section for automatic GPU discovery. Changes require a restart.

```toml
[drm]
ignored_pci_addresses = ["0000:01:00.0"]
# ignored_devices = ["/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:01:00.0-card"]
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ignored_devices` | string array | `[]` | Absolute card or render-node paths. Prefer stable `/dev/dri/by-path` links. |
| `ignored_pci_addresses` | string array | `[]` | PCI addresses in `domain:bus:slot.function` form. |

Umbriel does not bind or unbind PCI drivers. Configure that lifecycle in
libvirt or equivalent host tooling.

### Limits

- GPU exclusions affect native sessions only.
- Startup fails when no allowed GPU can initialize.
- Secondary GPUs must support the primary GPU's DMA-BUF formats and modifiers.
- Software rendering is incompatible with GPU exclusions.
- With exclusions, `WLR_BACKENDS` supports only `drm` and optional `libinput`.

## Environment

```toml
[environment]
ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT = "auto"
SDL_VIDEODRIVER = "wayland"
```

These variables apply to Umbriel and commands started in its session. In a
managed native session, they are also published to the systemd user manager for
session services such as Noctalia. Nested sessions do not modify the host
session environment.

Names must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, and values must be strings. Umbriel
owns its display and session variables, so this section cannot override
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_SOCKET`, `DISPLAY`, `UMBRIEL_SOCKET`,
`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP`, or `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.

Environment changes require an Umbriel restart. Fully quit and relaunch
long-running applications that survived the restart.

Removing a key does not clear a value already published to the systemd user
manager. Run `systemctl --user unset-environment NAME` to remove it immediately,
or wait for the user manager to exit.

## Events

Run commands when the laptop lid closes or opens:

```toml
[events]
lid_close = "notify-send 'The laptop lid is closed!'"
lid_open = "notify-send 'The laptop lid is open!'"
```

Umbriel runs the command for the current lid state once during startup, after
the compositor IPC socket is ready, then runs commands when that state changes.
This also handles signing in while the lid is already closed or already open.
If the system reports more than one lid switch, the combined state remains
closed while any switch is closed. Device removal and re-addition during
suspend do not repeat a command unless the combined state actually changed.

Logical output actions can remove the laptop panel from the desktop instead of
merely powering it off:

```toml
[events]
lid_close = "umbriel msg output-disable:eDP-1"
lid_open = "umbriel msg output-enable:eDP-1"
```

## Screencast

Target-changing screencast actions ask for confirmation the first time they are
used during an active single-source share. Dismissing the panel cancels only the
pending action, so invoking one again asks again. Approval lasts until the share
ends.

```toml
[screencast]
disable_dynamic_confirmation = false
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disable_dynamic_confirmation` | bool | `false` | Apply set and follow actions immediately without first confirming them. This can expose another window or output after an accidental key press. |

## Scratchpads

With no `[[scratchpad]]` entries, Umbriel provides one implicit scratchpad named
`default`:

```toml
[keybinds]
"Mod+Shift+Space" = "window-move-to-scratchpad"
"Mod+Space" = "scratchpad-toggle"
```

To configure several scratchpads, give each one a unique name and include that
name in its actions:

```toml
[[scratchpad]]
name = "terminal"

[[scratchpad]]
name = "music"

[keybinds]
"Mod+Space" = "scratchpad-toggle:terminal"
"Mod+M" = "scratchpad-toggle:music"
```

Defining a named scratchpad removes the implicit `default`. See
[Scratchpads](scratchpad.md) for window assignment and behavior.

## Idle inhibition

Umbriel honors idle inhibitors only while their application surface is mapped
and visible. Switching away from its workspace, hiding it in a scratchpad,
disabling its output, or locking the session suspends the inhibitor until the
surface becomes visible again.
